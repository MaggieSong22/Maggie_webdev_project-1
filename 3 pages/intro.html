                <h2>What is Ratatouille?</h2>
                <p>Ratatouille is a classic French Provençal stewed vegetable dish, originating from the region of Nice. It's a vibrant, healthy dish made from a combination of fresh ingredients such as eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions, all cooked together in a flavorful tomato-based sauce. The dish is not only visually appealing, with its colorful layers of vegetables, but also packed with flavors that highlight the natural sweetness and richness of each ingredient. Traditionally, it's a humble, rustic meal meant to celebrate the season's harvest, but it has gained recognition worldwide as a symbol of wholesome French cuisine.

What makes ratatouille special is its versatility. While it is typically served as a side dish, it can also be enjoyed as a main course when paired with bread, rice, or pasta. The dish can be prepared in various ways—some prefer to layer the vegetables in a decorative pattern and bake them, while others stew them together for a more traditional presentation. No matter the method, ratatouille is loved for its simplicity, nourishing qualities, and ability to bring out the best in fresh, local produce.</p>
